I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Connecticut. I work on interesting and challenging problems of networks and security. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the computer science and engineering department at the University of California Santa Cruz in June 2022, under the supervision of [Dr. Chen Qian](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~qian/).
